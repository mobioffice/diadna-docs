title: "Barcode to Stone ID"
description: " This document is a **reference for developers** to implement barcode ‚Üí stoneId conversion and integrate with the vendor API in DiaDNA."
---

import { Form } from "/snippets/form.mdx";

## Overview

The **barcode to stone ID conversion** ensures that each stone is uniquely and accurately identified before being sent to the vendor‚Äôs API.  

- **Rough stones** ‚Üí Send only the base code (e.g., `ABCD`).  
- **Split/Polished stones** ‚Üí Append the part suffix (e.g., `.1`, `.2`) to indicate the derived stone.
